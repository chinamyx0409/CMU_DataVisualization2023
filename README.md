By using the Top 10 Genre filter, I were able to identify the most common genres among Netflix users in various countries.

It is interesting to note that Netflix has a strong presence in both the US and India, which could potentially lead to significant business growth through transmission of information between the West and Asia. However, internet connectivity may be a significant obstacle to reaching markets in impoverished countries such as Sudan, Slovakia, Somalia, Uganda, and Kazakhstan.

(ii) Does Netflix has more focus on TV shows than movies in the recent years? Refer Total Movies & TV Shows by years.

It appears that Netflix has been adding more movies than TV shows in recent years, although there has been a decrease in the number of movie additions since 2019. Further analysis would be needed to determine if this indicates a shift in Netflix's focus or strategy.
